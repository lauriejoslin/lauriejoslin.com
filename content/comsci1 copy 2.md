Description: an insight into facial recognition technology, from the Viola-Jones algorithm to GANs.

I recently completed a course on Udemy exploring Computer Vision, by means of three differing technologies: the Viola-Jones algorithm, Single-shot Multibox Detection (SSD) and Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs). I found it useful to not only get to grips with these algorithms, but interesting to consider the applications of such algorithms in real life, oftentime applications that have come under considerable ethical scrutiny, for instance Deepfakes created by GANs. At the same time, it was also useful to understand to a greater depth the algorithms that power the Big Brother-esque technology we see in news headlines. 

The first main technology included in the course, the Viola-Jones algorithm, was used more to illustrate an intuitive understanding of how a non-neural algorithm could go about recognising faces, for instance.
