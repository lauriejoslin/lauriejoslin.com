i'm a 16 year old a-level student based in the uk, currently studying maths, further maths and physics. i hope to study computer science at university, ideally at the University of Cambridge. i enjoy all things maths and computer science, and love to learn new things i've never come across before! i am also very interested in history and politics, and have a great fascination with the complex domain of government; i hope one day i will be able to bring these interests together in the work that i do. i also love to play the piano, and completed my ABRSM grade 8 during the lockdown period.
